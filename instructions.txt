example_TI contains compressed (.tgz files) with exemplifying input files to reproduce the TI calculations on a representative structure presented in the manuscript.
each compressed directory contains input/output geometries, TI input files and bash scripts used to prepare and run the computational protocol
in TI_simul.tgz the final result computed for the 12 windows is also reported (all_ti).
