This repository contains input structures and input files (Amber and Plumed), as well as instructions, that can be used to reproduce calculations and computational protocols reported in the paper "JAK3 inhibitors: covalent and non-covalent interactions of a cyanamide group investigated by multiscale free-energy simulations".
Relevant output files are also reported.
